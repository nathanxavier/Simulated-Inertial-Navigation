# Simulated Inertial Navigation

This GitHub Project Repository was created based on the paper: ***UAV Inertial Navigation by Deep Neural Networks Applied in a Simulated Environment***

 The main.ipynb code was developed in Python (Jupyter).
 
 The scene needs to be opened in CoppeliaSim, and pushed the play button.
 The scene is complete, having the sensors, drones, and any communication needed.

We used the CoppeliaSim Version 4.6.0 (rev. 18)
